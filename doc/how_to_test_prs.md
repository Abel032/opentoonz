# Testing Pull Requests (PRs)

When a PR is submitted, it is compiled automatically by AppVeyor and Travis CI. The AppVeyor build creates an artifact which contains the OpenToonz executable and supporting DLLs needed to run.  You can easily download this artifact and run it to test out the PR before it is merged.

## Pre-Testing Notes
- You need to have OpenToonz already installed.  Do not uninstall.
- It is recommended that you backup your `C:\OpenToonz stuff` folder before testing a PR.
- The AppVeyor build does not contain an updated `C:\OpenToonz stuff` folder so any PR changes to default configurations (i.e. stylesheets, FXs, brushes, etc) are not automatically included.
- It is recommended when testing to use new scenes that you can throw away.
  - If you decide to test on an existing scene, back it up first!
